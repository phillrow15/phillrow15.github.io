00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.729
It sounds like it's echoing.

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:13.729
Echoing... huh?

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.729
How is it?

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:16.729
Everyone, this voice...

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.729
Does it sound doubled? Maybe?

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:22.729
Why?

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:25.729
Ah.

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:28.729
Ah...

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:29.729
Wait, wait, wait!

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:31.729
Could you wait a moment, please?

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:35.729
Starting off with a complete mess, huh?

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:38.729
Whoa, whoa, whoa, just a sec, okay?

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:41.729
How do I do this?

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:44.729
Alrighty!

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:48.729
Ah, can you hear me okay normally?

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:51.729
It's echoing on the stream side.

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:52.729
Ehhh?

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:53.729
H-How do I...?

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:55.729
ONITA OFF

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:57.729
Huh?

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:59.729
What should I do?

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:03.729
Okay, please wait a moment, everyone.

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:04.729
Ah, sorry about that.

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:06.729
Even though so many people came to see me...

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:09.729
Hmm...

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:11.729
What should I do?

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:14.729
W-W-What should I do?

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:15.729
The theme disappeared.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:17.689
And furthermore,

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:18.129
Here,

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.729
Come home.

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.729
Thank you.

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:23.265
Kowa-maa (Scary-maa)

00:03:23.265 --> 00:03:23.729
On my end, it's doubled.

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:24.729
Stacy-

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:25.729
san.

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:26.729
Waah!

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:27.765
Very...

00:03:27.765 --> 00:03:30.765
The sound is still on in the browser...

00:03:30.765 --> 00:03:32.765
That's not it...

00:03:33.265 --> 00:03:34.765
Umm...

00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:35.729
Ah, sorry for the rough start!

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:37.729
It's getting fired up for me.

00:03:39.765 --> 00:03:41.265
I wonder why...

00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:44.265
It was totally fine until just now.

00:03:46.265 --> 00:03:47.765
Umm...

00:03:50.265 --> 00:03:51.765
Umm...

00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:53.765
Well, whatever...

00:03:57.265 --> 00:03:58.765
Well, no!

00:04:00.265 --> 00:04:03.265
Um, can I just do the opening skit now?

00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:05.265
Sorry for the wait!

00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:06.265
Alright!

00:04:06.765 --> 00:04:08.765
Okay, let's start from the beginning!

00:04:08.765 --> 00:04:09.765
Bang!

00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:12.265
Oh no! I'm late, I'm late!

00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:14.765
I'm Shigure Ui, an illustrator!

00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:17.265
I really like high school girls, but...

00:04:17.265 --> 00:04:19.765
I'm getting older, so...

00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:21.765
If I publicly announce that I like high school girls...

00:04:21.765 --> 00:04:24.265
I'm starting to think that might be a problem.

00:04:24.386 --> 00:04:28.806
So, my plan is to become a high school girl myself to smooth things over!

00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:30.766
I've started the stream!

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:32.886
Hehehe.

00:04:32.886 --> 00:04:35.446
Moo~

00:04:35.446 --> 00:04:38.626
Moo~

00:04:38.626 --> 00:04:40.206
Was I doing that while muted?

00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:41.146
You were~

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:46.146
I was doing it all by myself~

00:04:46.146 --> 00:04:48.466
Um, is there anyone here who's a staff member?

00:04:48.466 --> 00:04:53.086
If you know how to fix this double audio issue I'm hearing,

00:04:53.086 --> 00:04:54.406
please tell me everything!

00:04:54.406 --> 00:04:55.605
Ehehe.

00:04:55.605 --> 00:04:57.406
Well, never mind.

00:04:57.406 --> 00:05:01.605
I kinda want to cut out the beginning part, but

00:05:01.605 --> 00:05:02.586
I guess I can't?

00:05:02.586 --> 00:05:04.846
Well, never mind.

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:07.486
So, actually, I've

00:05:07.486 --> 00:05:09.426
become able to move!

00:05:09.426 --> 00:05:11.286
What do you think?

00:05:11.286 --> 00:05:12.926
Ehehe.

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:14.586
This bread is in the way.

00:05:14.586 --> 00:05:16.266
Oh well, whatever.

00:05:16.266 --> 00:05:19.626
I don't need bread and marshmallows.

00:05:19.626 --> 00:05:22.686
Tada!

00:05:22.686 --> 00:05:23.066
Tada!

00:05:23.066 --> 00:05:23.086
Tada!

00:05:23.086 --> 00:05:25.086
Hehe.

00:05:25.086 --> 00:05:26.806
I can move now!

00:05:27.137 --> 00:05:31.298
You can totally tell where I'm looking, huh?

00:05:31.298 --> 00:05:34.617
I can look down and up.

00:05:34.617 --> 00:05:36.057
Hehe.

00:05:36.057 --> 00:05:37.597
Huh? What?

00:05:37.597 --> 00:05:39.817
Are any of the Hololive members here?

00:05:39.817 --> 00:05:42.737
Oh, uh, thank you.

00:05:42.737 --> 00:05:44.937
I, I want to find them!

00:05:44.937 --> 00:05:46.817
I want to find them, but...

00:05:46.817 --> 00:05:50.777
I'm so all over the place, I don't even know anymore.

00:05:50.777 --> 00:05:54.697
Ugh, ugh, ugh.

00:05:54.697 --> 00:05:59.517
You know, I was actually practicing a lot of skits and stuff by myself, you know?

00:05:59.517 --> 00:06:01.937
Embarrassingly enough.

00:06:01.937 --> 00:06:06.337
But, hearing my own voice doubled is...

00:06:06.337 --> 00:06:10.737
I'm panicking too much to understand anything!

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:13.877
Ugh, ugh.

00:06:13.877 --> 00:06:16.037
Ah, I want to add a wrench!

00:06:16.037 --> 00:06:19.397
Wrench, wrench...

00:06:19.397 --> 00:06:20.537
Spam?

00:06:20.537 --> 00:06:22.037
Wrench!

00:06:22.037 --> 00:06:24.617
I don't really know where it is.

00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:24.677
Wrench!

00:06:24.677 --> 00:06:26.217
I want to add a wrench.

00:06:26.217 --> 00:06:28.257
I wonder if I can add it later?

00:06:29.057 --> 00:06:31.057
Streaming is hard...

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.557
Ah, I found Tuvalu!

00:06:32.557 --> 00:06:34.557
I found Tuvalu!

00:06:36.057 --> 00:06:38.057
Gonna touch it.

00:06:39.557 --> 00:06:40.557
This one?

00:06:45.057 --> 00:06:46.057
Did it work?

00:06:46.057 --> 00:06:47.057
I don't know.

00:06:48.557 --> 00:06:50.057
Ah, it's not spam!

00:06:51.057 --> 00:06:52.557
It's not spam!

00:06:52.557 --> 00:06:53.557
Sorry about that.

00:06:53.557 --> 00:06:54.557
It's a spanner, right?

00:06:54.557 --> 00:06:55.557
It's a spanner, right?

00:06:55.557 --> 00:06:56.557
Sorry about that.

00:06:56.557 --> 00:06:58.557
I don't understand anything anymore...

00:06:59.057 --> 00:07:01.057
Aaaaah...

00:07:01.057 --> 00:07:03.057
I'm so nervous...

00:07:03.057 --> 00:07:04.057
Geez...

00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:05.057
This is such a mess...

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:07.057
Phew...

00:07:07.057 --> 00:07:08.057
Agh...

00:07:08.057 --> 00:07:10.057
Oozora Spam (referring to Oozora Subaru)

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:15.057
I laughed so hard I think my emotions died for a second.

00:07:18.057 --> 00:07:20.057
Um, this, this Live2D model...

00:07:20.057 --> 00:07:23.057
Was made by someone named Tona-san.

00:07:23.057 --> 00:07:24.057
Thank you, friend.

00:07:24.057 --> 00:07:25.057
Thank you, my friend.

00:07:25.057 --> 00:07:28.057
Actually, even after I said I was going to stream...

00:07:28.057 --> 00:07:29.057
Actually, like...

00:07:29.057 --> 00:07:31.057
About six months have passed.

00:07:31.057 --> 00:07:31.745
It's not really something to...

00:07:31.745 --> 00:07:34.145
...be keeping secret, I guess.

00:07:34.145 --> 00:07:38.365
First of all, for those who are meeting me for the first time...

00:07:38.365 --> 00:07:39.985
Why is an illustrator...

00:07:39.985 --> 00:07:41.005
...doing a virtual avatar?

00:07:41.005 --> 00:07:43.765
Basically, you're probably thinking, 'Who the heck are you?'

00:07:43.765 --> 00:07:44.925
Because I'm good at it, you see.

00:07:44.925 --> 00:07:49.445
I'd like to give a quick explanation.

00:07:49.445 --> 00:07:52.045
Um, well, I'm a VTuber's...

00:07:52.045 --> 00:07:55.286
...of the Hololive member, Oozora Subaru's...

00:07:55.286 --> 00:07:57.205
...kind of, you know, her supporter, or...

00:07:57.205 --> 00:07:59.286
...her parent, I guess.

00:07:59.286 --> 00:08:00.545
And one day...

00:08:00.545 --> 00:08:03.325
...I jokingly used a lip-sync app to...

00:08:03.325 --> 00:08:06.346
...do the 'Jimen-chan Babiniku' thing.

00:08:06.346 --> 00:08:08.525
I wonder if anyone knows about it.

00:08:08.525 --> 00:08:13.185
It's this one.

00:08:13.185 --> 00:08:15.945
There was a time when I was really into lip-sync apps.

00:08:15.945 --> 00:08:17.525
I got hooked on lip-sync apps.

00:08:17.525 --> 00:08:18.846
Yeah, and with this...

00:08:18.846 --> 00:08:20.985
...I was able to get a Live2D body, yay!

00:08:20.985 --> 00:08:23.286
I was making a fuss about it.

00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:26.185
Then Oozora Subaru saw that and...

00:08:26.185 --> 00:08:28.605
...suddenly sent me a DM.

00:08:28.605 --> 00:08:30.346
She said, "Mom..."

00:08:30.346 --> 00:08:34.306
"...since you got a Live2D body, wanna do a collab stream?"

00:08:35.138 --> 00:08:40.138
"I think it'd be funny if Ai-chan appeared on stream."

00:08:40.138 --> 00:08:44.138
Oozora Subaru, who I'd barely met...

00:08:44.138 --> 00:08:48.138
...sent me a DM.

00:08:48.138 --> 00:08:51.138
I thought, "That's hilarious!"

00:08:51.138 --> 00:08:57.138
It was so funny that I ended up joining the stream.

00:08:57.138 --> 00:09:02.138
Well, I couldn't exactly go live with my hair like this,

00:09:02.138 --> 00:09:05.138
so I thought I'd just go with a virtual avatar for a while.

00:09:05.138 --> 00:09:10.138
And I drew a standing picture in like 2 or 3 hours.

00:09:10.138 --> 00:09:12.138
That's this.

00:09:12.138 --> 00:09:15.138
Look, I look a little younger than I do now, right?

00:09:17.138 --> 00:09:20.138
Actually, when it came to animating it,

00:09:20.138 --> 00:09:22.138
I redrew it to make it look a little nicer.

00:09:22.138 --> 00:09:24.138
Just a tiny bit, though.

00:09:26.138 --> 00:09:27.138
Yeah.

00:09:27.138 --> 00:09:30.138
And I was doing collaborations and stuff with this still image,

00:09:30.138 --> 00:09:32.138
and popping in on other people's streams,

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:34.138
but...

00:09:34.138 --> 00:09:35.138
it was just so...

00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:43.833
fun! There were so many people willing to play with me, it was so much fun!

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:52.793
Then, around New Year's, Sora Subaru told me she wanted my 'mom' to move too.

00:09:52.793 --> 00:10:00.573
That made me so happy, so happy that before I knew it, this is what happened.

00:10:00.573 --> 00:10:05.553
I started moving too!

00:10:05.553 --> 00:10:14.953
Honestly, I didn't think I'd end up like this either, so I'm really surprised. Thanks for pulling me into this, Sora Subaru!

00:10:14.953 --> 00:10:25.894
I'm sure the illustrators I know are thinking, 'Oh, she's finally doing it,' but I hope they'll watch over me with a warm heart.

00:10:25.894 --> 00:10:30.494
Or better yet, get your own avatar and let's play together!

00:10:30.494 --> 00:10:32.494
Hehe.

00:10:32.494 --> 00:10:33.494
Alright.

00:10:33.494 --> 00:10:35.494
Oh yeah, this is totally unrelated, but...

00:10:35.494 --> 00:10:35.533
Oh yeah, this is totally unrelated, but...

00:10:35.533 --> 00:10:37.533
When I was going to talk about this episode,

00:10:37.697 --> 00:10:39.697
uh... in preparation for talking about it,

00:10:40.197 --> 00:10:43.298
I was looking back at my DMs with Subaru,

00:10:44.418 --> 00:10:45.117
and...

00:10:45.638 --> 00:10:47.877
We hit 3000 subscribers!

00:10:47.877 --> 00:10:50.217
Yay! I'm so happy, Mom! That's the kind of

00:10:50.658 --> 00:10:52.418
DM I received.

00:10:52.997 --> 00:10:54.997
3000, huh...

00:10:55.298 --> 00:10:57.957
It's gotten pretty sentimental.

00:11:00.918 --> 00:11:05.518
Wow, to think I've grown so much... and here I am on my first stream,

00:11:05.518 --> 00:11:09.617
wondering if it's okay to just talk about other people.

00:11:09.617 --> 00:11:12.758
Please subscribe to Oozora Subaru's channel as well!

00:11:13.977 --> 00:11:15.337
Thank you!

00:11:15.337 --> 00:11:17.877
Fubuki-chan is giving me OBS advice?

00:11:18.758 --> 00:11:20.357
Eh? There are 4000 people?

00:11:20.357 --> 00:11:21.577
Wait, wait, wait.

00:11:21.577 --> 00:11:23.197
Um, calm down, everyone.

00:11:23.197 --> 00:11:24.697
No, *I'll* calm down.

00:11:24.697 --> 00:11:25.857
Just a moment, please.

00:11:25.857 --> 00:11:26.898
About Fubuki-chan,

00:11:26.898 --> 00:11:28.278
About Fubuki-chan,

00:11:28.278 --> 00:11:30.577
I want to find out her good points.

00:11:31.278 --> 00:11:32.918
Thank you for telling me!

00:11:35.518 --> 00:11:38.758
I'm so nervous, I can't stop my heart from racing!

00:11:40.385 --> 00:11:42.385
Ah-

00:11:42.385 --> 00:11:44.385
Did it maybe get cut off?

00:11:46.145 --> 00:11:48.145
Did it maybe get cut off?

00:11:50.545 --> 00:11:52.545
Heeh-

00:11:54.706 --> 00:11:56.706
It got cut off, huh.

00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:01.505
Would it be faster to look at the tweet?

00:12:01.505 --> 00:12:04.145
Ah, can I take a quick look at Twitter?

00:12:04.145 --> 00:12:07.826
Sorry everyone, for looking at Twitter during the stream...

00:12:07.826 --> 00:12:09.826
White hair

00:12:09.826 --> 00:12:11.826
White hair

00:12:11.826 --> 00:12:13.826
Buki

00:12:13.826 --> 00:12:15.826

00:12:19.826 --> 00:12:21.826
Audio Details Properties

00:12:21.826 --> 00:12:23.826
Um...

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.826
Hmm hmm.

00:12:25.826 --> 00:12:27.826
If I turn off the monitor, I guess you won't hear episode 22 anymore.

00:12:27.826 --> 00:12:29.826
If I turn off the monitor, I guess you won't hear episode 22 anymore.

00:12:29.826 --> 00:12:31.826
Thank you, I'll try that.

00:12:31.826 --> 00:12:33.826
Thank you, I'll try that.

00:12:33.826 --> 00:12:35.826
In OBS's properties...

00:12:35.826 --> 00:12:37.826
In OBS's properties...

00:12:37.826 --> 00:12:39.826
Um...

00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:41.826
Microphone...

00:12:41.826 --> 00:12:43.826
Monitor...

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:46.514
The monitor's off, though.

00:12:46.514 --> 00:12:48.514
Why is that?

00:12:48.514 --> 00:12:52.514
Could it be I have a browser open somewhere?

00:12:54.514 --> 00:12:56.514
I did! (It was open!)

00:12:56.514 --> 00:12:58.514
Idiot!

00:12:58.514 --> 00:13:02.514
Thank you, Fubuki-chan.

00:13:02.514 --> 00:13:05.514
I'm surprised at my own stupidity.

00:13:05.514 --> 00:13:07.514
Eek!

00:13:07.514 --> 00:13:09.514
I'm so sorry.

00:13:09.514 --> 00:13:11.514
I'm so sorry.

00:13:11.514 --> 00:13:13.514
Haa...

00:13:13.514 --> 00:13:14.514
Ugh...

00:13:14.514 --> 00:13:17.514
Well, I learned something new.

00:13:17.514 --> 00:13:19.514
So, these things happen.

00:13:19.514 --> 00:13:21.514
Hehe.

00:13:21.514 --> 00:13:23.514
Okay.

00:13:23.514 --> 00:13:25.514
Seriously, thank you all so much.

00:13:25.514 --> 00:13:27.514
I'm so sorry.

00:13:27.514 --> 00:13:29.514
I was just, I was way too nervous.

00:13:29.514 --> 00:13:31.514
Hehehe.

00:13:31.514 --> 00:13:33.514
Being alone is so lonely.

00:13:33.514 --> 00:13:35.514
Ah...

00:13:35.514 --> 00:13:36.514
Yeah...

00:13:36.514 --> 00:13:38.514
That's right.

00:13:38.514 --> 00:13:40.514
I realized it from Fubuki-chan's tweet.

00:13:40.514 --> 00:13:41.514
Yeah, with the hashtag.

00:13:41.514 --> 00:13:42.514
About the hashtag,

00:13:42.514 --> 00:13:43.514
I want to decide on one.

00:13:43.514 --> 00:13:45.514
She tweeted that she wants to decide on one.

00:13:46.913 --> 00:13:48.913
That was kind of funny.

00:13:48.913 --> 00:13:52.514
Yeah, I want to decide on a hashtag.

00:13:52.514 --> 00:13:57.514
Does anyone have any good ideas for a hashtag?

00:13:57.514 --> 00:14:01.514
If we don't have one, it'll just be like 'Ui Shigure Live' or something.

00:14:01.514 --> 00:14:03.514
Like sake (raw sake).

00:14:03.514 --> 00:14:06.514
I can't drink raw sake, though.

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:12.514
I want a tag that's not too cutesy.

00:14:12.514 --> 00:14:14.514
My first self, Kesho (makeup).

00:14:14.514 --> 00:14:16.514
Um...

00:14:16.514 --> 00:14:18.514
Text text.

00:14:18.514 --> 00:14:20.514
Hashtag.

00:14:22.514 --> 00:14:24.514
Ui Live.

00:14:24.514 --> 00:14:26.514
Ui Nama Iccho! (Ui Live, let's go!)

00:14:29.514 --> 00:14:31.514
Sounds good!

00:14:31.514 --> 00:14:34.514
I want to decide on a hashtag, you know?

00:14:40.514 --> 00:14:43.514
How about 'I Want to Decide on a Hashtag' as the hashtag?

00:14:43.514 --> 00:14:44.514
I get it.

00:14:44.514 --> 00:14:46.514
That's no good.

00:14:46.514 --> 00:14:47.514
That's no good.

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:50.354
WiNama-kaa-chan (WiNama Mom)

00:14:52.354 --> 00:14:53.354
WiNama

00:14:53.354 --> 00:14:55.354
WiNama sounds nice.

00:14:55.354 --> 00:14:57.354
Maybe I'll go with WiNama.

00:14:59.354 --> 00:15:01.354
Oh, is there someone who tweeted with #Kimetai?

00:15:01.354 --> 00:15:04.354
Thank you! I'll check out #Kimetai later.

00:15:05.354 --> 00:15:06.354
Thank you.

00:15:06.354 --> 00:15:08.354
Okay, I'll go with WiNama then.

00:15:09.354 --> 00:15:13.354
W-W-WiNama

00:15:13.354 --> 00:15:15.354
Okay!

00:15:15.354 --> 00:15:17.354
Oh, it changed.

00:15:17.354 --> 00:15:18.354
Haa...

00:15:18.354 --> 00:15:22.354
Just typing these words is a struggle, you know.

00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:24.354
Because I'm an old lady.

00:15:24.354 --> 00:15:26.354
Haa...

00:15:26.354 --> 00:15:29.354
Well, thank you to everyone who gave me hashtag suggestions.

00:15:29.354 --> 00:15:31.354
Thank you, thank you.

00:15:31.354 --> 00:15:36.354
If you tweet with WiNama, I'll secretly look at it later and smile.

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:41.354
The bird behind me is, the bird is getting excited.

00:15:41.354 --> 00:15:44.354
I have a Java sparrow behind me today.

00:15:44.354 --> 00:15:47.354
It's in a really good mood today and singing.

00:15:47.354 --> 00:15:49.354
Sorry if it gets in the way.

00:15:49.378 --> 00:15:54.478
Well then, now that we've decided on the hashtag...

00:15:54.478 --> 00:15:56.858
Should I go for the marshmallows?

00:15:56.858 --> 00:15:59.278
Marshmallows, marshmallows!

00:15:59.278 --> 00:16:03.177
Thank you to everyone who sent me marshmallows!

00:16:03.177 --> 00:16:04.838
I've read them all.

00:16:04.838 --> 00:16:05.818
Alrighty!

00:16:05.818 --> 00:16:08.858
Okay, first marshmallow!

00:16:08.858 --> 00:16:09.818
Here we go!

00:16:09.818 --> 00:16:11.498
Kon'Ui!

00:16:11.498 --> 00:16:13.818
I have a question for Shigure Ui-sensei.

00:16:13.818 --> 00:16:17.338
There are times when I feel like I'm going to lose to sleepiness while working.

00:16:17.338 --> 00:16:19.698
What would Shigure Ui-sensei do?

00:16:19.698 --> 00:16:22.518
I'd like to know if there's anything you do.

00:16:22.518 --> 00:16:23.698
This, huh?

00:16:23.698 --> 00:16:24.978
Kon'Ui!

00:16:24.978 --> 00:16:29.418
I thought the greeting that makes it sound like there are more (greetings) was funny, so I included it.

00:16:29.418 --> 00:16:35.438
You know how you get so sleepy when you're trying to work?

00:16:35.438 --> 00:16:38.618
I usually lose the battle.

00:16:38.618 --> 00:16:43.598
If it's a time when it's okay to lose,

00:16:43.598 --> 00:16:44.978
I think it's okay to give in!

00:16:44.978 --> 00:16:45.638
Or is it not?

00:16:45.638 --> 00:16:46.718
Eh?

00:16:46.718 --> 00:16:47.218
Ah.

00:16:47.218 --> 00:16:47.317
Ah.

00:16:47.317 --> 00:16:47.338
Ah.

00:16:47.338 --> 00:16:48.698
Ah, is Aqua-chan here?

00:16:48.698 --> 00:16:50.177
Thank you, Aqua-chan!

00:16:50.177 --> 00:16:51.278
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:16:52.066 --> 00:16:55.865
I want to add a spanner, not spam!

00:16:56.946 --> 00:17:00.066
Found...found...found it!

00:17:00.066 --> 00:17:01.506
I want to find it!

00:17:02.266 --> 00:17:03.266
Ah...

00:17:03.346 --> 00:17:04.506
It's difficult.

00:17:06.105 --> 00:17:07.746
I can't find it.

00:17:09.506 --> 00:17:12.066
Just, just later, I'll add it later.

00:17:12.066 --> 00:17:13.546
I wonder if I can add it later?

00:17:13.546 --> 00:17:15.226
I'll add it later, thank you.

00:17:15.226 --> 00:17:17.905
Wow, thank you all so much for coming despite being so busy.

00:17:17.905 --> 00:17:19.425
I really appreciate it.

00:17:20.026 --> 00:17:21.506
This isn't spam, by the way.

00:17:22.066 --> 00:17:23.385
Sorry about that!

00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:28.145
I'm so happy you all came!

00:17:28.865 --> 00:17:31.506
Oh, and about these marshmallows...

00:17:31.506 --> 00:17:33.506
I usually just end up falling asleep, so...

00:17:33.506 --> 00:17:35.826
If it's not like, right before a deadline or a test...

00:17:35.826 --> 00:17:38.865
I think it's okay to just go to sleep!

00:17:39.306 --> 00:17:41.145
But sometimes, like with work or something...

00:17:41.145 --> 00:17:43.746
There are times when you just can't sleep because of a deadline, right?

00:17:43.746 --> 00:17:45.586
I think that happens.

00:17:45.586 --> 00:17:48.865
In that case, I'll have some caffeine.

00:17:48.865 --> 00:17:51.625
Like, I'll drink tea or something.

00:17:52.066 --> 00:17:54.185
What was it again?

00:17:54.185 --> 00:17:56.066
Monster or something.

00:17:57.186 --> 00:17:58.026
Red Bull, maybe.

00:17:58.369 --> 00:18:00.069
I could have those, but...

00:18:00.069 --> 00:18:02.429
I'm not very good at drinking carbonated drinks.

00:18:02.429 --> 00:18:04.329
It's not that I can't drink them...

00:18:04.329 --> 00:18:06.269
It's just that it takes me two or three hours to drink one can.

00:18:06.269 --> 00:18:08.289
It takes me two or three hours to finish one can.

00:18:08.289 --> 00:18:09.449
So it doesn't really work for me.

00:18:09.449 --> 00:18:12.089
So it doesn't really have any effect.

00:18:12.089 --> 00:18:14.849
So when I'm gonna 'dope up'...

00:18:14.849 --> 00:18:16.329
I drink Lipovitan D or something.

00:18:16.329 --> 00:18:17.389
I drink Lipovitan D or something.

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:20.089
But I don't think you should take too much caffeine.

00:18:20.089 --> 00:18:21.629
But I don't think you should take too much caffeine.

00:18:21.629 --> 00:18:22.289
Let's sleep.

00:18:22.289 --> 00:18:24.069
Alright, let's have this person sleep.

00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:25.129
Let's sleep.

00:18:25.129 --> 00:18:27.169
Alright, let's move on to the next one.

00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:30.369
I am terribly sorry for the inconvenience.

00:18:30.369 --> 00:18:33.029
I thought you were a hardcore fan of Ookozora Subaru.

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:34.489
I still think so.

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:36.449
That's right.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:37.949
Okay, next question.

00:18:37.949 --> 00:18:41.289
When drawing illustrations,

00:18:41.289 --> 00:18:43.089
I'd like to know the settings for the pens you often use.

00:18:43.089 --> 00:18:44.669
Could you tell me about that?

00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:47.509
I use Clip Studio Paint,

00:18:47.509 --> 00:18:49.449
as the software.

00:18:49.449 --> 00:18:50.549
And for that,

00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:52.789
the downloadable content,

00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:55.750
the downloadable pen,

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.029
I mostly draw with something called 'Pencil R'.

00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:59.509
I mostly draw with that.

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:07.657
For the colors, I use the thick, thick, thick watercolor-ish one that's there from the start.

00:19:07.657 --> 00:19:11.437
And I also use the airbrush here and there.

00:19:11.437 --> 00:19:13.217
That's about it.

00:19:13.217 --> 00:19:16.217
Alright, let's move on to the next one.

00:19:16.217 --> 00:19:20.157
Are you a Takenoko no Sato person or a Kinoko no Yama person?

00:19:20.738 --> 00:19:22.597
Personally, I like Black Thunder.

00:19:22.597 --> 00:19:25.397
I like Sakusaku Panda.

00:19:25.397 --> 00:19:31.557
I think those who know this story are probably thinking, 'How many times are we hearing this?'

00:19:31.557 --> 00:19:34.957
Those Sakusaku Pandas aren't being sold.

00:19:34.957 --> 00:19:37.217
They're not being sold, you know?

00:19:37.217 --> 00:19:39.577
Even though I like them...

00:19:39.577 --> 00:19:45.677
Those slightly premium Sakusaku Pandas are being sold here and there, though.

00:19:45.677 --> 00:19:51.357
But those white and black, super basic Sakusaku Pandas aren't being sold anywhere.

00:19:51.357 --> 00:19:55.377
I wonder what I can do to help Kabaya.

00:19:55.397 --> 00:19:58.817
Can I? I want them to put them in the supermarket near my house.

00:19:58.817 --> 00:20:02.357
But Black Thunder is also delicious, isn't it?

00:20:03.746 --> 00:20:10.286
If I had to choose between Takenoko and Kinoko, which would it be... I like both, but if I had to choose...

00:20:10.286 --> 00:20:14.306
Takenoko, I guess. But let's not start a war.

00:20:14.306 --> 00:20:19.086
Let's keep the peace. Okay, next.

00:20:19.246 --> 00:20:25.026
I can't decide how to refer to Chigure Ui-sensei. I'm an indecisive fan. How would the teacher like to be called?

00:20:25.026 --> 00:20:29.306
What feels right? Everyone,

00:20:29.306 --> 00:20:36.306
What do you call me? Honestly, I'm really happy no matter what you call me.

00:20:36.306 --> 00:20:41.306
So, Shigure Ui, Ui Shigure, Oishi Gure, anything is fine, but I think a lot of people call me Ui Mama.

00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:45.986
I guess a lot of people call me Ui Mama.

00:20:45.986 --> 00:20:51.786
Eh, Robo-chan's here? I wanna find Robo-chan, Supa!

00:20:51.786 --> 00:20:56.246
I wanna give Supa a name!

00:20:56.246 --> 00:21:03.246
How many times have we done this? And I still can't find her.

00:21:03.246 --> 00:21:05.857
Robo-chan...

00:21:05.857 --> 00:21:11.238
Thanks for letting me know. Even with Riga-too-ge, I can't find her.

00:21:11.238 --> 00:21:13.677
Hmm...

00:21:13.677 --> 00:21:20.897
Ah, sorry. Speaking of names, Robo-chan used to call me...

00:21:20.897 --> 00:21:31.298
"Ui-chan Sensei," and I thought it was kinda cute. If you're wondering what to call me, feel free to call me Ui-chan Sensei or whatever you like, it's fine.

00:21:31.298 --> 00:21:36.397
Ah, I found Robo-chan! I found Robo-chan! Found her, found her!

00:21:36.397 --> 00:21:38.978
Alright!

00:21:41.057 --> 00:21:45.117
The appeal is helpful. The appeal is helpful.

00:21:45.117 --> 00:21:49.917
Good job. Should I end the stream? Whew.

00:21:49.917 --> 00:21:57.197
Just kidding! You can call me whatever you like.

00:21:57.197 --> 00:21:59.238
I wonder...

00:21:59.238 --> 00:22:01.278
I don't really do much ego-searching, but...

00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:06.197
When I tweeted the name of a BAD VTuber before...

00:22:06.721 --> 00:22:09.521
I got a like, and I was really happy.

00:22:10.021 --> 00:22:13.321
Ah, I was thinking, maybe I should ego-search more often?

00:22:13.321 --> 00:22:15.021
I was kinda thinking that.

00:22:15.021 --> 00:22:16.321
So, like...

00:22:16.321 --> 00:22:18.622
I'd like you to tweet with a name that's easy for me to ego-search.

00:22:18.622 --> 00:22:21.321
Something like that.

00:22:23.122 --> 00:22:24.321
Yeah, that's it.

00:22:26.422 --> 00:22:27.321
Alright!

00:22:29.321 --> 00:22:31.721
Alright, let's move on to the next marshmallow.

00:22:34.122 --> 00:22:35.922
Subaru-chan, please let me marry you!

00:22:35.922 --> 00:22:37.721
Take it, you thief!

00:22:37.721 --> 00:22:38.821
Just kidding, just kidding!

00:22:38.821 --> 00:22:39.821
No way!

00:22:40.321 --> 00:22:41.321
Okay, next.

00:22:41.922 --> 00:22:44.321
I love your icon and your Babiniku

00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:46.422
appearance, Sensei, they're so cute.

00:22:46.422 --> 00:22:47.721
Thank you.

00:22:48.021 --> 00:22:49.721
So, my question is,

00:22:49.721 --> 00:22:52.221
is there any kind of motif behind it?

00:22:52.521 --> 00:22:53.521
This, huh?

00:22:53.521 --> 00:22:55.521
It's pretty much an afterthought now,

00:22:55.521 --> 00:22:58.021
but it's kind of become that way.

00:22:58.422 --> 00:22:59.221
Um...

00:22:59.221 --> 00:23:02.021
I really, really love sleeping, you know?

00:23:02.622 --> 00:23:03.721
Like, the day before yesterday,

00:23:03.721 --> 00:23:05.821
I ended up sleeping for about 18 hours.

00:23:05.922 --> 00:23:07.221
Privately.

00:23:07.362 --> 00:23:08.961
Because I love sleeping,

00:23:08.961 --> 00:23:11.362
I thought I'd go with a sheep motif.

00:23:11.362 --> 00:23:13.442
Oh, I have a rough sketch!

00:23:13.442 --> 00:23:14.922
Like, something like this.

00:23:14.922 --> 00:23:17.682
This is what it looks like from the front.

00:23:17.682 --> 00:23:19.842
This part of the hair...

00:23:19.842 --> 00:23:22.382
Like, what should I call it?

00:23:22.382 --> 00:23:24.682
I made it with the image of a sheep's fleece.

00:23:24.682 --> 00:23:26.282
That's the image I used.

00:23:26.282 --> 00:23:28.342
Hehe.

00:23:28.342 --> 00:23:29.382
What do you think?

00:23:29.382 --> 00:23:31.882
But maybe it doesn't really matter.

00:23:31.882 --> 00:23:35.122
But I wanted to add something fluffy.

00:23:35.122 --> 00:23:35.922
Okay.

00:23:37.362 --> 00:23:39.322
Heave-ho.

00:23:39.322 --> 00:23:39.922
Ah, wrong.

00:23:39.922 --> 00:23:41.201
Erase this one.

00:23:41.201 --> 00:23:43.402
Umm...

00:23:43.402 --> 00:23:46.402
Maybe the marshmallow next?

00:23:46.402 --> 00:23:49.262
Just a moment.

00:23:49.262 --> 00:23:53.762
Something...

00:23:53.762 --> 00:23:56.842
Erase the marshmallow.

00:23:56.842 --> 00:23:59.122
Huh?

00:24:00.662 --> 00:24:01.102
Something...

00:24:01.102 --> 00:24:04.382
Doesn't anyone hear a weird noise?

00:24:04.522 --> 00:24:04.762
Alright everyone,

00:24:04.762 --> 00:24:07.002
So,

00:24:07.362 --> 00:24:10.262
I'm going to try turning off the BGM.

00:24:14.561 --> 00:24:15.741
That's the one.

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:17.201
Oh?

00:24:19.121 --> 00:24:20.942
Oh?

00:24:24.541 --> 00:24:26.381
dadadadadadadadada

00:24:26.381 --> 00:24:28.341
BAAAAAAAM!

00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:29.801
Good evening!

00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:32.921
This is Adult Subaru.

00:24:32.921 --> 00:24:34.661
Here comes trouble!

00:24:34.661 --> 00:24:37.001
It's not trouble, really.

00:24:37.001 --> 00:24:40.501
Grandma! Congrats on your first stream!

00:24:40.501 --> 00:24:41.801
Thank you.

00:24:41.801 --> 00:24:43.861
Thank you~

00:24:43.861 --> 00:24:50.861
I'm technically the one posting, so here's a handsome guy who bumped into me.

00:24:50.861 --> 00:24:56.861
I had Oozora Subaru-san become something that bumped into me.

00:24:56.861 --> 00:25:00.861
Yay! Oozora Subaaaa! Please!

00:25:00.861 --> 00:25:03.861
I'm being called the noise cancellation person.

00:25:03.861 --> 00:25:06.861
That's wrong, I'm not doing noise cancellation.

00:25:06.861 --> 00:25:11.861
You know, I've been watching the stream with Mio-chan the whole time.

00:25:11.861 --> 00:25:16.861
How embarrassing, this person is doubling the audio.

00:25:17.665 --> 00:25:20.665
They're going to think I'm muted.

00:25:20.665 --> 00:25:22.165
Seriously?

00:25:22.165 --> 00:25:23.665
Mio-chan

00:25:23.665 --> 00:25:25.665
I love Mio-chan's fortune telling.

00:25:25.665 --> 00:25:28.165
Oh, I'll have her tell my fortune again sometime.

00:25:28.165 --> 00:25:30.165
I want her to tell my fortune.

00:25:30.165 --> 00:25:30.665
Yeah.

00:25:30.665 --> 00:25:32.665
Definitely, definitely, definitely.

00:25:32.665 --> 00:25:35.665
You know, I was laughing so hard at that thing.

00:25:35.665 --> 00:25:38.965
Like, there was bread near your mouth.

00:25:38.965 --> 00:25:43.165
I was like, 'Why is there bread there?'

00:25:43.165 --> 00:25:47.165
No, it's like, you know, a shoujo manga thing from home.

00:25:47.165 --> 00:25:49.665
Because it's so dramatic, like...

00:25:49.665 --> 00:25:51.665
Because you had bread in your mouth at home, right?

00:25:51.665 --> 00:25:56.665
Suddenly, why is there bread near your mouth? It's so funny, I was laughing so hard.

00:25:56.665 --> 00:25:58.665
That's what you noticed?

00:25:58.665 --> 00:26:00.665
Now the bread's position, the bread's position...

00:26:00.665 --> 00:26:02.665
The bread's position...

00:26:02.665 --> 00:26:04.665
Never mind.

00:26:04.665 --> 00:26:05.665
You stopped?

00:26:05.665 --> 00:26:07.665
Stopped.

00:26:07.665 --> 00:26:10.165
Ah, Mio-chan, Mio-chan, you see...

00:26:10.165 --> 00:26:14.165
This wrench, wrench, wrench... it's hard to attach, isn't it?

00:26:14.165 --> 00:26:15.665
Ah, I'll teach you later.

00:26:15.665 --> 00:26:17.165
You can attach them all at once?

00:26:17.165 --> 00:26:18.665
Ah, that's right, about wrenches.

00:26:18.665 --> 00:26:20.385
Eh, really? As expected.

00:26:20.385 --> 00:26:22.385
You're a streaming veteran.

00:26:22.385 --> 00:26:22.885
Yay!

00:26:22.885 --> 00:26:24.086
Subaru, you see,

00:26:24.086 --> 00:26:26.885
Sometimes she puts on too many and gets scolded.

00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:29.385
That also happened, didn't it.

00:26:32.485 --> 00:26:33.385
Well, um...

00:26:33.385 --> 00:26:35.385
As a streaming veteran,

00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:37.385
Is there any advice you could give me?

00:26:37.385 --> 00:26:38.385
You want?

00:26:38.586 --> 00:26:40.185
Eh? Advice?

00:26:40.185 --> 00:26:41.385
Um...

00:26:41.385 --> 00:26:43.086
Well, somehow...

00:26:43.086 --> 00:26:46.385
Somehow Subaru is just naturally funny, so everyone's always...

00:26:46.385 --> 00:26:48.385
Don't let Subaru eat it anymore!

00:26:48.385 --> 00:26:50.385
Don't let Subaru eat it.

00:26:53.086 --> 00:26:54.086
It's fine.

00:26:54.385 --> 00:26:58.086
Hey, why are you suddenly getting so lively, Mom?

00:27:00.086 --> 00:27:01.086
Whew!

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:02.086
I was getting a little...

00:27:02.086 --> 00:27:03.086
...antsy!

00:27:03.586 --> 00:27:04.586
Why?

00:27:04.586 --> 00:27:07.586
You were so nervous just a little while ago!

00:27:08.086 --> 00:27:10.385
I guess I'm not nervous when it's just the two of us.

00:27:10.685 --> 00:27:11.685
Hey, wait!

00:27:12.086 --> 00:27:13.086
Oh, but I'm happy.

00:27:13.086 --> 00:27:14.086
I'm glad you came.

00:27:14.086 --> 00:27:14.586
I'm happy!

00:27:14.586 --> 00:27:16.586
No, really, thanks for coming.

00:27:16.586 --> 00:27:17.086
Yeah.

00:27:17.086 --> 00:27:18.086
Thank you too.

00:27:18.086 --> 00:27:18.786
Amazing!

00:27:18.786 --> 00:27:21.286
So many people are watching my first stream.

00:27:21.286 --> 00:27:24.385
I'm too scared to even look at what's being watched.

00:27:24.865 --> 00:27:34.685
Let's take a look... I can see it! Thank you, everyone! Thanks for watching at just the right time for a nap.

00:27:34.685 --> 00:27:38.506
Thank you, me!

00:27:38.506 --> 00:27:45.105
We can do a collab stream! Oh, right, I can do my perspective. How about it?

00:27:45.105 --> 00:27:52.786
The murderous mom... I'm actually not that good at it. Oops!

00:27:52.786 --> 00:27:55.665
I did it!

00:27:55.665 --> 00:28:01.346
It's not the German one. That weapon has stat boosts.

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:11.346
Oh, oh, oh, right, the weapon has stat boosts. Oh, oh, oh, oh. The kills that my teammates get probably count towards my kills with that weapon, I think.

00:28:11.346 --> 00:28:15.086
Yeah, Ink Armor, was it?

00:28:15.086 --> 00:28:25.306
So, yeah, I'm not *that* bloodthirsty. But if Subaru can use it too... Wait, this is my first stream! We're talking about Splatoon!

00:28:26.241 --> 00:28:28.241
Indeed.

00:28:28.241 --> 00:28:29.241
Nice and hot.

00:28:29.241 --> 00:28:31.241
Splatoon, nice and hot!

00:28:31.241 --> 00:28:33.241
Is this your parents' place?

00:28:33.241 --> 00:28:37.241
It's like being home, so comforting.

00:28:37.241 --> 00:28:39.241
Um, I was wondering...

00:28:39.241 --> 00:28:41.241
I wanted Subaru to teach me Minecraft.

00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:43.241
Oh, sure, leave it to me!

00:28:43.241 --> 00:28:45.241
Subaru's good at Minecraft, you know.

00:28:45.241 --> 00:28:46.241
Really?

00:28:46.241 --> 00:28:47.241
Yeah.

00:28:47.241 --> 00:28:48.241
Good.

00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:49.241
Before that, though...

00:28:49.241 --> 00:28:50.241
Um...

00:28:50.241 --> 00:28:51.241
I lost everything.

00:28:51.241 --> 00:28:53.241
I'll do better next time.

00:28:53.241 --> 00:28:55.241
So you're good, I see.

00:28:55.241 --> 00:28:56.241
Yeah, I'm good.

00:28:56.241 --> 00:28:57.241
You're good at losing everything?

00:28:57.241 --> 00:28:58.241
Sounds about right.

00:28:58.241 --> 00:29:00.241
Right?

00:29:00.241 --> 00:29:01.241
Losing everything isn't good.

00:29:01.241 --> 00:29:04.241
Losing everything is not good.

00:29:05.241 --> 00:29:06.241
Teach me.

00:29:06.241 --> 00:29:09.241
Teach me how to get good content.

00:29:09.241 --> 00:29:10.241
Um, like, you know?

00:29:10.241 --> 00:29:11.241
This thing here.

00:29:11.241 --> 00:29:15.241
Like, Mom's super aware of being a streamer, you know?

00:29:15.241 --> 00:29:17.241
That's not true!

00:29:17.241 --> 00:29:19.241
Like, even when we were having meetings,

00:29:19.241 --> 00:29:23.241
She was debating whether to say Subaru would appear beforehand or not.

00:29:23.241 --> 00:29:24.241
And then,

00:29:24.241 --> 00:29:25.241
Yeah.

00:29:25.241 --> 00:29:28.241
Then Mom was like, 'Which would be more interesting?'

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:33.290
Well, I was torn, you know.

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:36.670
I thought it might be more interesting if she suddenly appeared.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:39.390
Yeah, it was fun!

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.090
I'm glad.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:46.730
Mom, is there anything else you want to do?

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:50.830
Hmm.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:51.990
Subaru, um...

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:53.190
What? What is it?

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.210
Subaru, I want to color together!

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:58.250
Coloring? Sounds good!

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.210
Why are you laughing?

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.650
Well, it's a little... elementary school.

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.310
Coloring.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.930
I want to color.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:14.070
Yeah, I want to color and then show it to Mom.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.010
So cute!

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:18.490
Okay, I'll give you my drawing.

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:19.950
Feel free to color it.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:22.110
Okay, I'll color it freely.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:23.490
Don't you want to see Oji-Oji's drawing?

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:24.690
What?

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.850
Don't you want to see Oji-Oji's drawing?

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:28.170
Okay, so...

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:29.730
Let's all do some coloring!

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:30.930
Let's all do some coloring!

00:30:31.682 --> 00:30:36.602
Let's just color together. Coloring... oh yeah, that's right, coloring reminded me...

00:30:36.602 --> 00:30:43.862
I was watching Mom's stream and thought, 'So that's what color palettes are!'

00:30:43.862 --> 00:30:55.122
And this... what was it... an illustration site? Yeah, that's right. It's kind of... it doesn't really stand out, but you can understand it.

00:30:55.122 --> 00:31:02.622
Boo-ber Illustration site is amazing, huh? What kind of system is it?

00:31:02.622 --> 00:31:10.942
I was told by Tsukauyo-chan, 'It's not just about using black, red, and white!' I was laughing, though.

00:31:10.942 --> 00:31:21.362
The thumbnail was red and black text, wasn't it? Or was it black-bordered? Yeah, yeah, it was red text recently, but now it's white-bordered.

00:31:21.362 --> 00:31:24.162
Why?

00:31:25.122 --> 00:31:28.561
Ah, it's... Chink, it's Chink!

00:31:28.561 --> 00:31:31.801
Ki, ki, go, something, go-saiki.

00:31:34.465 --> 00:31:38.765
Yesterday's was red-bordered.

00:31:38.765 --> 00:31:41.925
It was a red-bordered white Mori.

00:31:41.925 --> 00:31:44.685
I'm laughing so hard I can't open my eyes.

00:31:44.685 --> 00:31:47.885
Open, open!

00:31:47.885 --> 00:31:49.585
Why won't it open?

00:31:49.585 --> 00:31:50.765
It opened, it opened!

00:31:50.765 --> 00:31:53.865
I almost became a character today.

00:31:53.865 --> 00:31:55.045
That was close, that was close.

00:31:55.045 --> 00:31:59.765
The kind where you know it's moving even with your eyes closed.

00:31:59.765 --> 00:32:04.905
Oh no, I could just keep chatting forever.

00:32:04.905 --> 00:32:06.005
Definitely.

00:32:06.005 --> 00:32:09.445
How many minutes of screen time does Subaru have?

00:32:09.445 --> 00:32:11.105
I didn't think about it at all.

00:32:11.105 --> 00:32:12.165
Hey.

00:32:12.165 --> 00:32:14.945
Just going with the flow.

00:32:14.945 --> 00:32:17.425
Going with the flow.

00:32:17.425 --> 00:32:20.105
Should we head home soon?

00:32:21.025 --> 00:32:22.625
Huh? What should I do?

00:32:22.625 --> 00:32:23.125
What should we do?

00:32:23.785 --> 00:32:24.346
What should we do?

00:32:24.885 --> 00:32:26.885
What's that? Hey, what should I do?

00:32:26.885 --> 00:32:27.445
What should we do?

00:32:28.645 --> 00:32:29.405
Suddenly.

00:32:29.405 --> 00:32:29.745
Suddenly...

00:32:29.745 --> 00:32:31.225
Suddenly, like...

00:32:31.225 --> 00:32:32.346
That thing from earlier...

00:32:32.346 --> 00:32:35.105
Spam, spam...

00:32:35.105 --> 00:32:35.925
Shut up!

00:32:37.634 --> 00:32:39.634
Spam is delicious, right?

00:32:39.634 --> 00:32:41.634
I love spam!

00:32:41.634 --> 00:32:42.634
You like it?

00:32:42.634 --> 00:32:43.634
I love spam!

00:32:43.634 --> 00:32:46.634
Ah, so Subaru, don't you have any announcements or anything?

00:32:46.634 --> 00:32:47.634
Announcements?

00:32:47.634 --> 00:32:48.634
Yeah.

00:32:48.634 --> 00:32:55.634
Announcement: there will be hell from 11 PM tomorrow.

00:32:57.634 --> 00:32:59.634
You're regularly doing hell streams, huh?

00:32:59.634 --> 00:33:03.634
Yeah, this week's hell stream is tomorrow from 11 PM.

00:33:03.634 --> 00:33:06.634
I see, everyone, let's go watch hell together.

00:33:06.634 --> 00:33:11.634
Um, so, um, I think Tenkai-senpai already put it out, so it should be okay, but...

00:33:11.634 --> 00:33:13.634
Hoh hoh hoh hoh.

00:33:13.634 --> 00:33:17.634
We're doing a 'Worst Thumbnail Championship'.

00:33:19.634 --> 00:33:22.634
Isn't that topic a little too timely?

00:33:23.634 --> 00:33:25.634
I didn't even know that!

00:33:25.634 --> 00:33:32.634
So, Subaru came up with this idea, and it just happened to overlap with Ojioji's plan, so we decided to watch it together.

00:33:33.634 --> 00:33:35.634
We should definitely go see it!

00:33:35.634 --> 00:33:36.634
Umm...

00:33:36.634 --> 00:33:40.634
It's Amamai-senpai vs. Mai-moto Ojioji vs. Subaru!

00:33:40.634 --> 00:33:41.634
Yeah.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:55.730
And the judges are Fubuki-senpai, Dola-sama, Sasaki Saku-chan, and Jorikiichi-senpai.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:56.730
Wow, that's amazing!

00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:03.730
Wow, incredible! I've never seen a project where Subaru gets completely roasted by people she's just met.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:07.730
Alright, yeah, go all out! Go all out! Use black text!

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:14.730
I'm going to inherit my mom's bloodline. If anything happens, she'll be like, 'She's Shigurely's kid!'

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:17.730
Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't smear mud on me! Hey, hey, hey!

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:21.730
I'm not smearing mud! I'm not smearing mud!

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:31.730
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. Tomorrow at 11 PM.

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:36.730
Yeah, tomorrow at 11 PM on Ochiocho's channel. Please check it out!

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:37.730
Roger that.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:41.730
Wow, I feel satisfied. Can I end the stream now?

00:34:42.465 --> 00:34:45.465
Yeah, that's super early Subaru.

00:34:45.465 --> 00:34:47.465
Early Subaru would stream for about 30 minutes...

00:34:47.465 --> 00:34:49.465
And then say, 'I've got nothing else to do, guess I'll end it.'

00:34:49.465 --> 00:34:50.465
I was waiting.

00:34:50.465 --> 00:34:53.465
I kinda understand how you feel now.

00:34:53.465 --> 00:34:54.465
You understand, Mom?

00:34:54.465 --> 00:34:56.465
I understand!

00:34:56.465 --> 00:34:58.465
Mom, aren't you gonna do that?

00:34:58.465 --> 00:35:00.465
Like, streaming while drawing?

00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:02.465
I wanna do it, I wanna do it!

00:35:02.465 --> 00:35:03.465
I think I will.

00:35:03.465 --> 00:35:04.465
I wanna do it~

00:35:04.465 --> 00:35:06.465
Subaru should watch how I draw and...

00:35:06.465 --> 00:35:08.465
...use it as reference.

00:35:08.465 --> 00:35:10.465
Then let's draw together!

00:35:10.465 --> 00:35:12.465
Yeah, let's draw together~

00:35:12.465 --> 00:35:13.465
Yay~!

00:35:13.465 --> 00:35:15.465
So many fun things to do~

00:35:15.465 --> 00:35:18.465
Did you do that thing?

00:35:18.465 --> 00:35:19.465
The hashtag, I mean.

00:35:19.465 --> 00:35:21.465
This is a live broadcast, right?

00:35:21.465 --> 00:35:22.465
It's a live broadcast.

00:35:22.465 --> 00:35:24.465
That, uh, that thing...

00:35:24.465 --> 00:35:26.465
But is there a fan art tag?

00:35:26.465 --> 00:35:27.465
Yeah.

00:35:27.465 --> 00:35:29.465
It's #Ui_Shigure.

00:35:29.465 --> 00:35:30.465
#Ui_Shigure

00:35:30.465 --> 00:35:31.465
If you draw with #Ui_Shigure...

00:35:31.465 --> 00:35:34.465
...I'll immediately go look and save it.

00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:38.465
Mom has 10,000 subscribers!

00:35:38.465 --> 00:35:39.465
Congrats!

00:35:39.465 --> 00:35:40.465
Seriously, Mom?

00:35:40.465 --> 00:35:41.465
Mommy!

00:35:41.465 --> 00:35:42.465
Ehhh?

00:35:42.465 --> 00:35:43.465
Ah, thank you!

00:35:43.713 --> 00:35:47.713
Thanks for watching, even though it was a total mess.

00:35:47.713 --> 00:35:50.213
Thank you for subscribing!

00:35:50.213 --> 00:35:53.213
Yay! Happy, congrats, Mom!

00:35:53.213 --> 00:35:56.713
Thank you! Please subscribe to Oozora Subaru too!

00:35:56.713 --> 00:35:58.713
Thank you, thank you!

00:35:58.713 --> 00:36:02.713
Please do! I'm so happy, thank you!

00:36:02.713 --> 00:36:09.713
Okay, last but not least, what are your aspirations for the future, Mom?

00:36:09.713 --> 00:36:16.713
Here... Seriously... Uh... I'm gonna keep teasing Subaru about the weather!

00:36:16.713 --> 00:36:19.713
Hey, what's this?

00:36:19.713 --> 00:36:25.713
I now have my own frame, a new... place, so I'm gonna keep teasing her here too.

00:36:25.713 --> 00:36:28.713
Yeah, she's completely out of control, can't put her in here anymore.

00:36:28.713 --> 00:36:31.713
She'll just eat the bread without asking!

00:36:31.713 --> 00:36:35.713
Seriously, I can't get her to stop eating the bread!

00:36:35.713 --> 00:36:39.713
Well, I guess being in charge of OBS isn't so bad.

00:36:39.713 --> 00:36:43.713
Alrighty! Hey!

00:36:44.577 --> 00:36:50.257
Let's do this again sometime! Thank you for coming!

00:36:50.257 --> 00:36:54.858
Thank you too! Good luck! Bye-bye!

00:36:54.858 --> 00:36:56.858
Bye-bye!

00:37:01.097 --> 00:37:04.097
Ah, only the publishing is left.

00:37:04.097 --> 00:37:11.898
I really enjoy talking to Subaru. We end up having these endless, almost philosophical conversations.

00:37:11.898 --> 00:37:16.418
I'd like to try reading it on my stream too sometime.

00:37:16.418 --> 00:37:23.538
So, honestly, this whole being-late thing... there's a part of me that did it because I wanted to clash with Subaru.

00:37:23.538 --> 00:37:25.657
I'll go to the normal room now.

00:37:25.657 --> 00:37:28.577
Alright, classroom.

00:37:28.577 --> 00:37:34.498
Isn't this super cute? This is the design for my doujinshi.

00:37:34.498 --> 00:37:39.858
Bafa-chuu-san made it. Isn't it adorable?

00:37:39.858 --> 00:37:41.418
And the microphone and stuff.

00:37:41.418 --> 00:37:41.878
Ehehehe.

00:37:41.878 --> 00:37:45.677
This is just a coincidence, but when I get close to the microphone...

00:37:46.242 --> 00:37:49.322
Even in this illustration, she gets close to the microphone.

00:37:49.322 --> 00:37:50.362
She looks really angry.

00:37:50.362 --> 00:37:56.522
Alright, I'm going to continue reading the Marshmallows.

00:37:56.522 --> 00:37:58.722
Alright, alright.

00:37:58.722 --> 00:38:05.382
Wi-sensei, thank you always for the beautiful illustrations.

00:38:05.382 --> 00:38:07.162
Thank you too.

00:38:07.162 --> 00:38:10.662
I hear Wi-sensei is a DereSte min.

00:38:10.662 --> 00:38:13.222
Please tell me your favorite character and song.

00:38:13.222 --> 00:38:15.922
Whoa, this is going to be long.

00:38:15.922 --> 00:38:17.842
I was the one who chose this,

00:38:17.842 --> 00:38:24.262
But I think there might be some people who don't know Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,

00:38:24.262 --> 00:38:26.542
So I'll explain it quickly.

00:38:26.542 --> 00:38:31.242
My assigned idol is a girl named Asari Nanami,

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:36.522
She's got fluffy blue hair and loves fish, and she's kind of like a loris, but not really.

00:38:36.522 --> 00:38:39.442
She's a super, super cute girl.

00:38:39.442 --> 00:38:45.282
If there's anyone who's having trouble deciding on an idol to support,

00:38:45.282 --> 00:38:45.722
Definitely,

00:38:45.722 --> 00:38:46.442
Leave a comment,

00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:47.657
I want you to read it.

00:38:47.657 --> 00:38:48.657
Definitely, definitely,

00:38:48.657 --> 00:38:49.657
I recommend her!

00:38:49.657 --> 00:38:52.657
There are so many songs I like,

00:38:52.657 --> 00:38:55.657
Um, the ones that come to mind right now are,

00:38:58.657 --> 00:39:00.657
Sayonara Andromeda, and...

00:39:01.657 --> 00:39:04.657
Milia's Romantic Now, and...

00:39:05.657 --> 00:39:09.657
Gin no Iruka to Atsui Kaze (Silver Dolphin and Hot Wind), and...

00:39:10.657 --> 00:39:11.657
Oh, I can't forget,

00:39:11.657 --> 00:39:13.657
I also love Love Letter.

00:39:13.657 --> 00:39:16.657
When it comes to cute songs,

00:39:16.657 --> 00:39:18.657
I really like Cute Make My Day.

00:39:18.657 --> 00:39:20.657
I love it!

00:39:21.657 --> 00:39:24.657
Oh man, if I start talking about it, I'll never stop!

00:39:24.657 --> 00:39:27.657
Ah, I also love Kira's full-blown smile!

00:39:28.657 --> 00:39:30.657
Yeah, Inotaku-san, you know?

00:39:30.657 --> 00:39:32.657
I really like him!

00:39:32.657 --> 00:39:34.657
I also really love Crazy Crazy!

00:39:34.657 --> 00:39:36.657
It's so good, isn't it?

00:39:37.657 --> 00:39:38.657
Ah, is NanaKagu-chan here?

00:39:38.657 --> 00:39:39.657
Just a moment.

00:39:39.657 --> 00:39:42.657
I'm gonna do a super, super, super challenge!

00:39:43.657 --> 00:39:44.657
Ah, it's on!

00:39:44.657 --> 00:39:45.657
Alright!

00:39:45.657 --> 00:39:46.657
Is that okay?

00:39:46.657 --> 00:39:47.554
Hmph.

00:39:47.554 --> 00:39:49.114
I'm used to this now.

00:39:49.114 --> 00:39:52.954
I'm already used to being a streamer.

00:39:52.954 --> 00:39:54.094
Just kidding!

00:39:54.094 --> 00:39:55.074
Sorry!

00:39:55.074 --> 00:39:56.834
Next!

00:39:56.834 --> 00:40:01.114
Even though it's before my test, I'm definitely going to stream, says Ui-sensei!

00:40:01.114 --> 00:40:01.874
Thank you!

00:40:01.874 --> 00:40:03.213
Are you sure about your test?

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:04.094
Are you going to be okay?

00:40:04.474 --> 00:40:05.934
Good luck with your test studies!

00:40:05.934 --> 00:40:10.854
Do you have any BGM that you usually listen to when you draw?

00:40:11.173 --> 00:40:12.733
If you do, I'd love to know!

00:40:12.733 --> 00:40:14.713
Ui-sensei, both Ui-sensei and Ui-sensei's art...

00:40:14.713 --> 00:40:16.634
This part also makes me a little happy.

00:40:16.634 --> 00:40:19.534
It makes me happy, but I'm too embarrassed to say it myself, so I'll skip it.

00:40:19.534 --> 00:40:23.374
It's been getting hotter lately, so please take care of yourself.

00:40:23.374 --> 00:40:25.394
Thank you!

00:40:25.394 --> 00:40:28.934
And to everyone who sent me Marshmallows...

00:40:28.934 --> 00:40:31.434
Please take good care of your health!

00:40:31.434 --> 00:40:34.793
BGM, huh? When I'm drawing, I'm usually...

00:40:34.793 --> 00:40:37.574
Watching VTuber archives, I guess.

00:40:37.574 --> 00:40:39.974
But when I'm working on manga names or something...

00:40:39.974 --> 00:40:42.494
When I'm doing work that requires me to use my brain...

00:40:42.494 --> 00:40:43.634
I listen to instrumental...

00:40:43.634 --> 00:40:45.414
I listen to something like that.

00:40:45.414 --> 00:40:46.614
I listen to it often.

00:40:46.634 --> 00:40:48.434
Animal Crossing BGM

00:40:48.434 --> 00:40:48.634
Thank you for reading the subtitles for this video.

00:40:48.634 --> 00:40:48.693
Thank you for watching!

00:40:48.961 --> 00:40:50.961
That's the good stuff.

00:40:50.961 --> 00:40:52.961
It helps me concentrate and it's cute.

00:40:52.961 --> 00:40:54.961
Please give it a listen.

00:40:57.961 --> 00:40:59.961
Alright, then...

00:40:59.961 --> 00:41:02.961
Eh, is Cook-tan here?

00:41:02.961 --> 00:41:04.961
Ah, you're right!

00:41:04.961 --> 00:41:06.961
It's amazing how calm she is and that she's talking to me.

00:41:06.961 --> 00:41:08.961
Thank you so much.

00:41:08.961 --> 00:41:11.961
I was so happy to get a reply.

00:41:11.961 --> 00:41:14.961
I watch Cook-tan's cooking videos all the time.

00:41:14.961 --> 00:41:17.961
I've been studying onions recently.

00:41:18.961 --> 00:41:20.961
Thank you.

00:41:20.961 --> 00:41:22.961
Just a moment, please.

00:41:23.961 --> 00:41:25.961
Right, there's more, you know.

00:41:25.961 --> 00:41:27.961
Um, Fubuki-chan...

00:41:27.961 --> 00:41:29.961
I want to put it on Fubuki-chan too.

00:41:29.961 --> 00:41:31.961
Where is she?

00:41:38.961 --> 00:41:39.961
Ah, but...

00:41:40.961 --> 00:41:42.961
Isn't she here?

00:41:44.961 --> 00:41:45.961
She's not.

00:41:45.961 --> 00:41:47.961
Why not?

00:41:47.961 --> 00:41:48.961
Why not?

00:41:49.961 --> 00:41:50.961
Fubuki-chan...

00:41:50.961 --> 00:41:51.961
Ugh...

00:41:51.961 --> 00:41:52.961
Fubuki-chan...

00:41:52.961 --> 00:41:53.961
Phew...

00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:54.961
Fubuki-chan...

00:41:54.961 --> 00:41:56.961
Oooo...

00:41:56.961 --> 00:41:57.961
Oooo...

00:41:57.961 --> 00:41:59.961
Ah, but later, Subaru will...

00:41:59.961 --> 00:42:01.282
Subaru said she'll put them all...

00:42:01.282 --> 00:42:02.282
She said she can put them on.

00:42:02.822 --> 00:42:04.521
She said she can put them on, so...

00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:06.202
Even if I miss it here...

00:42:06.481 --> 00:42:08.562
Spanner Challenge...

00:42:08.562 --> 00:42:09.782
I can still do it.

00:42:10.402 --> 00:42:11.402
Definitely.

00:42:11.642 --> 00:42:12.642
That...

00:42:12.642 --> 00:42:13.742
I was wondering if the wrench icon appeared.

00:42:13.742 --> 00:42:15.182
I'd like you to come and take a look next time.

00:42:17.402 --> 00:42:19.242
Whoa, just a sec.

00:42:19.242 --> 00:42:21.582
I'm still not used to...

00:42:21.582 --> 00:42:23.162
reading the comments.

00:42:23.622 --> 00:42:24.622
Hmm...

00:42:26.222 --> 00:42:27.222
Ah!

00:42:27.222 --> 00:42:28.822
Mr. Hiragi is here too!

00:42:28.822 --> 00:42:30.322
Thank you so much!

00:42:30.322 --> 00:42:31.322
Thank you so much!

00:42:31.322 --> 00:42:34.822
Yesterday, I didn't know how to make the comments scroll at all,

00:42:34.822 --> 00:42:36.422
so I asked about it.

00:42:36.422 --> 00:42:37.422
Thanks!

00:42:37.922 --> 00:42:38.922
Whoa!

00:42:38.922 --> 00:42:40.822
Eh, is Mr. Urdan here too?

00:42:40.822 --> 00:42:41.422
Ehhh-

00:42:41.422 --> 00:42:42.422
Ah-

00:42:42.422 --> 00:42:43.422
Haa...

00:42:44.422 --> 00:42:45.822
Thank you very much.

00:42:46.122 --> 00:42:47.422
Thank you very much.

00:42:48.021 --> 00:42:49.021
I also...

00:42:49.422 --> 00:42:51.422
I want to give something back.

00:42:51.622 --> 00:42:52.622
Thank you.

00:42:52.922 --> 00:42:53.922
Umm...

00:42:54.122 --> 00:42:55.922
Well then, let's move on to the next marshmallow.

00:42:55.922 --> 00:42:56.922
Here we go!

00:42:57.422 --> 00:42:58.422
Alright!

00:42:58.822 --> 00:42:59.822
Juu-

00:42:59.822 --> 00:43:00.322
Yes.

00:43:00.322 --> 00:43:01.822
Ri-san, good evening!

00:43:02.177 --> 00:43:05.177
Good evening! I have a question right away,

00:43:05.177 --> 00:43:07.577
Are there any foods you dislike?

00:43:07.577 --> 00:43:12.978
I imagine you can eat anything deliciously, so I'm curious.

00:43:12.978 --> 00:43:16.978
It's been getting colder again lately, so please take care of your health.

00:43:16.978 --> 00:43:20.978
Thank you for always providing wonderful illustrations and fun chats.

00:43:20.978 --> 00:43:22.677
Thank you very much.

00:43:22.677 --> 00:43:25.177
Me too... huh? Me too?

00:43:25.177 --> 00:43:29.077
No, that's not right. Thank you for watching.

00:43:29.077 --> 00:43:31.577
Please take care of your health.

00:43:31.577 --> 00:43:35.978
Um... let's see, foods I don't like... not really...

00:43:35.978 --> 00:43:38.177
Well, there are some, I guess.

00:43:38.177 --> 00:43:41.978
Shiitake mushrooms... shii...

00:43:41.978 --> 00:43:44.177
But I can eat them if I try hard.

00:43:44.177 --> 00:43:46.177
I can eat them if I try hard.

00:43:46.177 --> 00:43:51.478
And... carrots too, I can eat them if I try hard.

00:43:51.478 --> 00:43:54.877
Hmm... but maybe I don't really like them.

00:43:54.877 --> 00:43:55.978
Hehe.

00:43:57.277 --> 00:44:00.777
Eh? Gil-sama is here?

00:44:00.777 --> 00:44:01.478
Seriously?

00:44:01.478 --> 00:44:03.478
Really? Nice to meet you.

00:44:03.681 --> 00:44:05.681
I always watch your streams.

00:44:05.681 --> 00:44:06.681
Hehe.

00:44:06.681 --> 00:44:08.681
I'm looking forward to your streams.

00:44:08.681 --> 00:44:10.681
Please stream!

00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:11.681
Hehe.

00:44:11.681 --> 00:44:13.681
Thank you.

00:44:13.681 --> 00:44:15.681
But I can't find it.

00:44:15.681 --> 00:44:17.681
Where is it?

00:44:17.681 --> 00:44:19.681
Aha.

00:44:19.681 --> 00:44:21.681
W-what?

00:44:21.681 --> 00:44:23.681
This is difficult.

00:44:23.681 --> 00:44:25.681
I'll look for it slowly later.

00:44:25.681 --> 00:44:26.681
Ehehe.

00:44:26.681 --> 00:44:27.681
Thank you very much.

00:44:27.681 --> 00:44:30.681
So many people came to see me, really.

00:44:30.681 --> 00:44:32.681
It's very... what should I say...

00:44:32.681 --> 00:44:34.681
It just pops up.

00:44:34.681 --> 00:44:35.681
Ehehe.

00:44:35.681 --> 00:44:37.681
Ehehe.

00:44:37.681 --> 00:44:39.681
Alright.

00:44:39.681 --> 00:44:41.681
That's right.

00:44:41.681 --> 00:44:43.681
So, the things I'm bad at are mostly shiitake mushrooms and...

00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:45.681
Carrots, but...

00:44:45.681 --> 00:44:47.681
Do I sound like an elementary school kid or something?

00:44:47.681 --> 00:44:49.681
I saw a comment like that.

00:44:49.681 --> 00:44:50.681
I saw it.

00:44:50.681 --> 00:44:51.681
Is that not the case?

00:44:51.681 --> 00:44:54.681
I'm not an elementary schooler, so I can eat properly.

00:44:54.681 --> 00:44:56.681
You can eat properly?

00:44:56.681 --> 00:44:57.681
Yeah.

00:44:57.681 --> 00:45:01.681
Also, I'm not very good with spicy food.

00:45:01.681 --> 00:45:02.681
I do like it, though.

00:45:02.681 --> 00:45:03.681
Not at all.

00:45:03.681 --> 00:45:05.681
Hmm.

00:45:05.681 --> 00:45:08.681
Maybe I'm just not good with stimulants.

00:45:10.338 --> 00:45:12.338
And carbonated drinks, I'm bad at drinking them.

00:45:13.238 --> 00:45:15.238
Ah, Kamame-chan!

00:45:17.698 --> 00:45:19.698
Haa, thank you for coming!

00:45:21.858 --> 00:45:22.658
I'm happy.

00:45:25.577 --> 00:45:26.338
I found you!

00:45:28.338 --> 00:45:28.838
I'm happy.

00:45:32.198 --> 00:45:35.338
Spicy food, you know, I'm not very good with it.

00:45:35.338 --> 00:45:38.938
My curry is mild, embarrassingly.

00:45:40.338 --> 00:45:45.338
Yeah, but you know, I hear from a lot of people that you can learn to eat spicy food.

00:45:45.338 --> 00:45:47.338
So I think I'll try to practice little by little.

00:45:47.338 --> 00:45:50.338
Like, I'll try to train myself.

00:45:52.338 --> 00:45:54.338
Okay, let's move on to the next marshmallow.

00:45:57.338 --> 00:45:58.338
A wonderful teacher.

00:45:58.338 --> 00:46:02.338
Sensei seems like she enjoys a relaxed and easygoing pace, but...

00:46:02.338 --> 00:46:05.338
I'd like to dare her to try a tongue twister.

00:46:05.338 --> 00:46:09.338
It can be a tongue twister you're confident you can say.

00:46:09.338 --> 00:46:10.338
During the stream,

00:46:10.338 --> 00:46:11.338
I'd be happy if you could show it off.

00:46:12.353 --> 00:46:16.134
Ah, is it obvious that I speak slowly?

00:46:18.393 --> 00:46:22.873
My brain, like, my words can't keep up, so I end up speaking really slowly.

00:46:22.873 --> 00:46:26.193
But I saw in some video,

00:46:26.193 --> 00:46:32.793
that apparently speaking faster makes it easier for people to understand the information.

00:46:32.793 --> 00:46:37.433
So I'm trying relatively hard to speak quickly today,

00:46:37.433 --> 00:46:41.913
but judging from the comments, it doesn't seem like it's working that well.

00:46:41.913 --> 00:46:49.593
I'll speak faster, okay?

00:46:49.593 --> 00:46:50.793
Watch me.

00:46:50.793 --> 00:46:53.073
I'll speak faster.

00:46:53.073 --> 00:46:55.853
I can also say tongue twisters.

00:46:55.853 --> 00:46:57.213
I haven't really said them much, though.

00:46:57.213 --> 00:46:58.773
What was it?

00:46:58.893 --> 00:46:59.513
Nama Mugi Nama...

00:46:59.513 --> 00:47:00.333
Nama...

00:47:00.333 --> 00:47:01.253
Nama Mugi...

00:47:01.253 --> 00:47:03.433
Nama Mugi Nama, sorry.

00:47:04.134 --> 00:47:04.453
Nama...

00:47:04.453 --> 00:47:06.653
Next!

00:47:06.653 --> 00:47:07.013
Yes!

00:47:07.013 --> 00:47:11.893
The light novel being released by Dengeki Bunko, 'My Childhood Friend Who Is Absolutely Going to Lose in Love Comedy'

00:47:11.913 --> 00:47:14.213
The cover illustration is so cute, so cute!

00:47:14.753 --> 00:47:18.953
I can't wait for the release date, June 8th! Could you tell me what the highlights are?

00:47:18.953 --> 00:47:20.953
This...

00:47:20.953 --> 00:47:22.953
This...

00:47:22.953 --> 00:47:25.953
I swear this isn't a self-written message!

00:47:25.953 --> 00:47:27.953
But it's so incredibly detailed and polite!

00:47:27.953 --> 00:47:30.953
From this publishing company, from the release date...

00:47:30.953 --> 00:47:33.953
Even the title of the work!

00:47:33.953 --> 00:47:36.953
Hey, are you a staff member or something?

00:47:36.953 --> 00:47:39.953
It's not me!

00:47:39.953 --> 00:47:42.953
Is it the editor? Or the author?

00:47:42.953 --> 00:47:44.953
I don't know, but thank you for sending it!

00:47:44.953 --> 00:47:47.953
That's right, on June 8th...

00:47:47.953 --> 00:47:49.953
It's being released...

00:47:49.953 --> 00:47:52.953
I was allowed to draw the cover illustration for that light novel.

00:47:52.953 --> 00:47:55.953
This is turning into an advertisement...

00:47:55.953 --> 00:47:57.953
It's a romantic comedy, you see.

00:47:57.953 --> 00:47:59.953
A three-way...

00:47:59.953 --> 00:48:02.953
Anyone who likes romantic comedies will definitely love it, so...

00:48:02.953 --> 00:48:05.953
Please give it a try!

00:48:05.953 --> 00:48:07.953
Oh, and also,

00:48:07.953 --> 00:48:08.953
Um,

00:48:08.953 --> 00:48:11.953
Around the 25th of this month, I think?

00:48:11.953 --> 00:48:12.953
Sounds cool.

00:48:12.953 --> 00:48:15.953
From MF Bunko J,

00:48:16.065 --> 00:48:18.765
the new volume of 'Aoiro Noise' will be released!

00:48:18.765 --> 00:48:19.805
Ehehe.

00:48:19.805 --> 00:48:22.725
It's a promo segment!

00:48:22.725 --> 00:48:24.865
And also, on the 31st,

00:48:24.865 --> 00:48:26.465
from Yurihime-san,

00:48:26.465 --> 00:48:28.005
there's this 'Parfait 3'

00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:30.765
onee-loli anthology coming out,

00:48:30.765 --> 00:48:31.985
and I drew the cover art for it,

00:48:31.985 --> 00:48:33.605
so, um, I got to draw it,

00:48:33.605 --> 00:48:35.005
so please take a peek

00:48:35.005 --> 00:48:36.826
if you'd like, I'd be happy.

00:48:36.826 --> 00:48:37.805
This promotion...

00:48:37.805 --> 00:48:39.105
Ehehe.

00:48:39.105 --> 00:48:40.225
Even though I'm promoting so much,

00:48:40.225 --> 00:48:41.565
Everyone says they appreciate the promotion.

00:48:41.565 --> 00:48:43.965
You guys are so kind!

00:48:43.965 --> 00:48:46.065
So nice!

00:48:46.065 --> 00:48:47.505
Ahahaha

00:48:47.505 --> 00:48:48.565
Thank you!

00:48:48.565 --> 00:48:49.465
Amazing!

00:48:49.465 --> 00:48:51.465
They're all great books, so please do check them out.

00:48:51.465 --> 00:48:52.826
If you're interested,

00:48:52.826 --> 00:48:54.565
I hope you'll take a peek.

00:48:54.565 --> 00:48:55.405
Hehe

00:48:55.405 --> 00:48:56.905
Okay, let's move on to the next one!

00:48:56.905 --> 00:48:58.725
Nice!

00:48:58.725 --> 00:49:01.125
What's your favorite food?

00:49:01.125 --> 00:49:04.305
I really love talking about food, don't I?

00:49:04.305 --> 00:49:06.265
Me, personally,

00:49:06.265 --> 00:49:08.225
My favorite foods are

00:49:08.225 --> 00:49:10.365
Cabbage and

00:49:10.365 --> 00:49:12.025
Cucumber and

00:49:12.025 --> 00:49:14.005
Eggs and

00:49:14.005 --> 00:49:15.205
Milk?

00:49:15.205 --> 00:49:16.025
Dairy products are

00:49:16.025 --> 00:49:16.322
Kind of like

00:49:16.322 --> 00:49:17.025
I like them.

00:49:17.025 --> 00:49:18.025
Ah, I'm so full.

00:49:18.025 --> 00:49:18.322
Look at my face.

00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:21.322
I like crunchy things and dairy products.

00:49:21.322 --> 00:49:25.322
So, I really like it when there's egg in something.

00:49:25.322 --> 00:49:30.025
When I told my friend I really like egg balls, they said, 'Are you in elementary school?'

00:49:30.025 --> 00:49:31.025
Delicious.

00:49:31.025 --> 00:49:32.125
And then...

00:49:32.125 --> 00:49:32.322
Tteokbokki.

00:49:32.322 --> 00:49:33.705
I suddenly feel so sad.

00:49:33.705 --> 00:49:34.322
ampal

00:49:34.322 --> 00:49:34.765
Egg balls are so good, you should try them.

00:49:34.765 --> 00:49:35.625
Well then...

00:49:35.625 --> 00:49:36.665
Onaru

00:49:36.665 --> 00:49:37.745
In the city...

00:49:37.745 --> 00:49:38.826
Let's talk.

00:49:38.826 --> 00:49:39.322
Shop exchange.

00:49:39.322 --> 00:49:39.826
I also like milk, so I have milk tea placed in front of me, or cows placed there.

00:49:39.826 --> 00:49:40.885
Phone.

00:49:40.885 --> 00:49:41.826
Found it.

00:49:41.826 --> 00:49:42.525
Electronic.

00:49:42.525 --> 00:49:42.725
Ah...

00:49:42.725 --> 00:49:43.245
Structure

00:49:43.245 --> 00:49:43.725
Bili

00:49:43.725 --> 00:49:44.225
Lar

00:49:44.225 --> 00:49:44.765
To make out (what's being said)

00:49:44.765 --> 00:49:45.145
Yeah

00:49:45.145 --> 00:49:45.665
Cho M n (short for Chotto Matte)

00:49:45.665 --> 00:49:45.885
Light

00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:56.322
I wonder if she likes egg dishes too.

00:49:56.322 --> 00:50:01.322
I wonder if she likes rolled omelets or omelet rice.

00:50:01.322 --> 00:50:04.322
But I pretty much like anything.

00:50:04.322 --> 00:50:08.322
Next, let's go to Washimaro.

00:50:09.322 --> 00:50:14.322
Nice to meet you, Ui-san. Does your Java sparrow perch on your hand while you're working?

00:50:14.322 --> 00:50:17.322
All the time, all the time.

00:50:19.809 --> 00:50:21.809
Choco-chan, my Java sparrow.

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:25.750
I was wondering what she was doing, so I took a peek and she was sleeping.

00:50:27.529 --> 00:50:29.529
She was so excited just a moment ago.

00:50:30.049 --> 00:50:33.809
Right, Choco-chan is usually in her cage, but...

00:50:34.329 --> 00:50:36.690
When I, how should I put it, unleash her...

00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:41.570
She's usually on top of my head, on my shoulder, or on my hand.

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:44.429
She's always in one of those three spots.

00:50:45.889 --> 00:50:47.889
Bunchou is so cute, you know?

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:49.650
So cute.

00:50:49.809 --> 00:50:50.650
Hehe.

00:50:51.429 --> 00:50:52.429
Cute.

00:50:54.509 --> 00:50:56.049
Yeah, I wonder what it is.

00:50:56.049 --> 00:50:59.349
Maybe this also depends on Bunchou, but...

00:50:59.349 --> 00:51:02.469
My Bunchou never goes far away.

00:51:02.469 --> 00:51:05.549
He's always on some part of my body, always.

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:09.049
Bunchou is so cute.

00:51:09.529 --> 00:51:12.610
Alright, let's move on to the next marshmallow.

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:14.130
Okay.

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:16.909
When I draw illustrations for a long time,

00:51:16.909 --> 00:51:19.110
My eyes get tired, and my shoulders get stiff.

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:20.190
I get quite a lot of...

00:51:20.289 --> 00:51:21.509
Physical problems.

00:51:21.509 --> 00:51:24.509
Shigure Ui, how do you take care of that kind of thing?

00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:25.349
That's a string I'm curious about.

00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:28.869
I really like that last 'a string I'm curious about' part,

00:51:28.869 --> 00:51:30.070
So I chose it.

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:32.710
Are you feeling alright?

00:51:33.289 --> 00:51:35.409
You know, if you keep working like that...

00:51:35.409 --> 00:51:37.150
Your shoulders end up like this

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:39.190
They start to feel sore, right?

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:42.110
I use a drawing tablet, though

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:45.849
I hold the tablet extremely close to my face

00:51:45.849 --> 00:51:47.409
Hmm, how should I put it...

00:51:47.409 --> 00:51:49.849
I stack a massive pile of books under the tablet

00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:51.929
like thick Jump magazines

00:51:51.929 --> 00:51:55.570
I raise it up and angle it toward my face

00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:58.690
so that it's parallel, and when I draw

00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:01.110
my posture improved a bit

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:05.690
Maybe angling it like that wasn't ideal

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:07.469
But perhaps

00:52:07.469 --> 00:52:10.289
It could be the tablet's fault

00:52:10.289 --> 00:52:11.610
I should regularly...

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:12.690
what should I do?

00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:13.289
stand up

00:52:13.289 --> 00:52:14.829
stand up and sit down

00:52:14.829 --> 00:52:16.309
rotate my arms

00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:17.570
do some radio calisthenics

00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:19.429
That might be good, right?

00:52:19.429 --> 00:52:20.210
Hehe.

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:25.570
Yeah, I tend to draw with my face super close to the screen.

00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:29.070
You should be careful with your health.

00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:30.570
To all the illustrators out there.

00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:33.570
And those who work at a desk too.

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:35.070
You'll die young!

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:36.570
Let's live a long life!

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:37.570
Alright.

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:40.570
Next marshmallow!

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:45.070
Congratulations on your first stream, Ui-san! & Thank you!

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:46.570
Thank you!

00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:49.070
Now that you're going to be streaming,

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:51.070
what kind of content will you be streaming?

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:54.070
How often will you be streaming, and

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:59.070
if you've decided on a streaming style, please let me know.

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:00.570
Sorry for the long message.

00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:02.070
I'll continue to support you!

00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:04.070
Thank you, I'm so happy!

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:06.070
Yeah, that's right.

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:07.070
I was just saying earlier,

00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:11.070
when I was talking with Subaru, I mentioned a bit about it,

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:15.070
but basically, I think it'll mostly be drawing streams.

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:16.070
Yeah.

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:20.070
I'd like to try doing something else if there's anything I can do,

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:21.070
but I'm really bad at

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:21.570
Oh, rare Trouble.

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:22.018
modifications

00:53:22.018 --> 00:53:22.070
games, I'm really bad at them. Seriously, I'm bad at like 80% of games.

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:27.070
I want to try Gospel.

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:28.197
Code.

00:53:28.197 --> 00:53:31.070
Showing it to you guys might be a bit... problematic, because I'm so bad at it. So, I'm a little hesitant.

00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:33.070
Drag.

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:35.070
Future button and paradigmas.

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:35.438
Subtitle adjustment.

00:53:35.438 --> 00:53:38.398
It's a tough decision.

00:53:38.398 --> 00:53:39.070
Hmm, oh, but Pokemon's coming out this year, right? Kentate and stuff.

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:41.070
Combo.

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:43.070
A already.

00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:43.958
Future button's peło.

00:53:43.958 --> 00:53:45.070
Oh, and Animal Crossing is coming out too, right? I really want to play that. I wonder if I can?

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:47.070
Friend Topping

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:49.070
Arrest

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:49.769
Scale

00:53:49.769 --> 00:53:51.070
Super

00:53:51.237 --> 00:53:59.918
Splatoon, really, it's only when I'm with Subaru that I play well. Usually, I'm like Gandhi.

00:53:59.918 --> 00:54:03.858
Like, always 0 kills.

00:54:04.858 --> 00:54:13.478
Ah, singing is a no-go. Really? I'm really bad at singing.

00:54:13.478 --> 00:54:18.518
It's not something I can share with you all. I like it though.

00:54:18.518 --> 00:54:21.217
It's kind of... doesn't fit the main stream.

00:54:21.217 --> 00:54:23.713
Like early Vocaloid.

00:54:23.713 --> 00:54:25.713
That's the kind of singing I do.

00:54:25.713 --> 00:54:27.713
Hehehe

00:54:27.713 --> 00:54:29.713
If I get good at singing, I'll sing.

00:54:29.713 --> 00:54:31.713
Whenever that will be.

00:54:31.713 --> 00:54:33.713
Hehehe

00:54:33.713 --> 00:54:35.713
Ah, that's true.

00:54:35.713 --> 00:54:37.713
But if there's a game that looks like I could play it,

00:54:37.713 --> 00:54:39.713
By all means,

00:54:39.713 --> 00:54:41.713
Please let me know.

00:54:41.713 --> 00:54:43.713
Ah, the Hololive Kindergarten song was cute.

00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:45.713
Thank you.

00:54:47.713 --> 00:54:49.713
I'm so happy to know there are people watching.

00:54:49.713 --> 00:54:51.713
Thank you.

00:54:51.713 --> 00:54:53.713
I thought she was good at Mario Kart, but...

00:54:53.713 --> 00:54:55.713
It's there.

00:54:55.713 --> 00:54:57.713
No, I'm not saying she's bad, but...

00:54:57.713 --> 00:54:59.713
That girl definitely...

00:54:59.713 --> 00:55:01.713
Is working incredibly hard behind the scenes.

00:55:01.713 --> 00:55:03.713
That's one of the things I love about her.

00:55:03.713 --> 00:55:05.713
Probably like...

00:55:05.713 --> 00:55:07.713
So, so much...

00:55:07.713 --> 00:55:09.713
Until she's satisfied with it.

00:55:09.713 --> 00:55:11.713
She's working so hard...

00:55:11.713 --> 00:55:13.713
I think that's what she's doing.

00:55:13.713 --> 00:55:15.713
She's such a good girl.

00:55:15.713 --> 00:55:17.713
Yeah, yeah.

00:55:17.713 --> 00:55:19.713
Ah, Mario Kart.

00:55:19.713 --> 00:55:21.713
I want to try it.

00:55:21.713 --> 00:55:23.713
Actually, I have a driver's license.

00:55:24.802 --> 00:55:28.142
I can drive safely, you know.

00:55:28.142 --> 00:55:31.322
I feel like I'm good at it.

00:55:31.322 --> 00:55:33.382
I haven't really done it much before, but...

00:55:33.382 --> 00:55:36.822
I guess that's about it.

00:55:36.822 --> 00:55:40.041
If there's anything else you'd like me to do,

00:55:40.041 --> 00:55:41.981
feel free to send a little message via Marshmallow or something.

00:55:41.981 --> 00:55:43.562
Let me know!

00:55:43.562 --> 00:55:44.862
Ah, horror games...

00:55:44.862 --> 00:55:45.981
Horror games, huh?

00:55:45.981 --> 00:55:49.722
The thing I'm worst at after spicy food is...

00:55:49.722 --> 00:55:51.362
Horror.

00:55:51.362 --> 00:55:55.682
I absolutely don't want to do it unless it's a punishment game.

00:55:55.682 --> 00:55:57.302
Absolutely don't want to do it!

00:55:57.302 --> 00:55:59.442
I'm already scared, I'm already...

00:55:59.442 --> 00:56:00.702
I can't do it!

00:56:00.702 --> 00:56:02.541
I'll probably, like, really...

00:56:02.541 --> 00:56:05.942
React like someone who's really bad with horror.

00:56:05.942 --> 00:56:07.922
I think I'll just go silent.

00:56:07.922 --> 00:56:08.981
I won't be like, 'Kyaa!' or anything.

00:56:08.981 --> 00:56:11.342
It'll be more like...

00:56:11.342 --> 00:56:13.842
I don't think you'll think much of it.

00:56:13.842 --> 00:56:17.041
Ah, if I'm with Subaru, it won't be scary.

00:56:17.041 --> 00:56:19.182
I see.

00:56:19.182 --> 00:56:20.822
That might be true.

00:56:20.822 --> 00:56:22.562
Maybe it's not so scary.

00:56:22.562 --> 00:56:24.722
Maybe I should give it a try.

00:56:24.722 --> 00:56:25.242
But still...

00:56:25.762 --> 00:56:27.762
Well...

00:56:27.762 --> 00:56:30.602
Well, I wouldn't want to do it unless it's a punishment game.

00:56:30.602 --> 00:56:32.602
Hehehe.

00:56:32.602 --> 00:56:34.602
It's scary, though!

00:56:34.602 --> 00:56:36.602
It's scary, though!

00:56:36.602 --> 00:56:39.102
Huh? What? Is Fuuki-chan locking on to me?

00:56:39.102 --> 00:56:40.102
What is it? What is it?

00:56:40.102 --> 00:56:41.102
Hehehe.

00:56:41.102 --> 00:56:42.102
Locking on!

00:56:42.102 --> 00:56:43.602
I don't know what it is, but...

00:56:43.602 --> 00:56:45.602
I hope she wants to play with me.

00:56:45.602 --> 00:56:47.602
Hehehe.

00:56:47.602 --> 00:56:48.602
Hehehe.

00:56:48.602 --> 00:56:49.602
Is that the feeling?

00:56:49.602 --> 00:56:50.602
Heave-ho!

00:56:50.602 --> 00:56:53.602
Actually, there's a screen that's not just marshmallows, you know.

00:56:54.602 --> 00:56:55.602
Heave-ho!

00:56:55.762 --> 00:56:57.602
Ta-da!

00:56:57.602 --> 00:56:59.602
You can actually post comments properly.

00:56:59.602 --> 00:57:01.602
Hehehe.

00:57:01.602 --> 00:57:04.602
I wasn't very good at reading comments today, though.

00:57:04.602 --> 00:57:07.602
No, thank you for commenting!

00:57:07.602 --> 00:57:10.602
Oh, what? Are you locking on? A horror game?

00:57:10.602 --> 00:57:12.602
Oh, really?

00:57:12.602 --> 00:57:14.602
Fuuki-chan, um...

00:57:14.602 --> 00:57:16.602
Um...

00:57:16.602 --> 00:57:18.602
How about we play Mario Kart or something?

00:57:18.602 --> 00:57:20.602
Hehehe.

00:57:20.602 --> 00:57:23.602
Um, I don't think horror games are a good idea.

00:57:23.602 --> 00:57:25.602
If we all play Mario Kart together...

00:57:25.602 --> 00:57:26.602
It'll be fun!

00:57:26.602 --> 00:57:27.602
It'll be fun!

00:57:27.617 --> 00:57:33.378
Something like that.

00:57:33.378 --> 00:57:39.317
Seriously, thank you so much to everyone who sent marshmallows!

00:57:39.317 --> 00:57:42.077
I've read them all, every single one!

00:57:42.077 --> 00:57:43.538
Thank you so, so much.

00:57:43.538 --> 00:57:47.398
I'm really sorry I can't reply to them all individually,

00:57:47.398 --> 00:57:51.777
but I think I'll be able to answer some of them during drawing streams or something,

00:57:51.777 --> 00:57:56.197
so I'm thinking of answering them then.

00:57:56.197 --> 00:57:59.418
It's not just questions, you know,

00:57:59.418 --> 00:58:03.958
some people sent me their thoughts on my work and that made me so happy!

00:58:03.958 --> 00:58:06.418
Thank you, I'm reading everything!

00:58:06.418 --> 00:58:07.717
Thank you!

00:58:07.717 --> 00:58:12.797
Isn't this screen so cute?

00:58:12.797 --> 00:58:15.577
Bafachu made it for me.

00:58:15.577 --> 00:58:17.938
Bafachu is really good at design.

00:58:18.097 --> 00:58:22.117
I'll tell you who they are on Twitter later,

00:58:22.117 --> 00:58:25.418
so please go check them out!

00:58:25.418 --> 00:58:25.757
Hehe.

00:58:25.757 --> 00:58:27.777
Oh, right!

00:58:28.257 --> 00:58:31.557
So many different Vtubers came to watch today,

00:58:31.557 --> 00:58:34.137
which made me so, so, so, so happy!

00:58:34.137 --> 00:58:37.057
I'm just an independent... independent, right?

00:58:37.057 --> 00:58:37.977
Just for fun?

00:58:37.977 --> 00:58:39.377
I'm just doing this as a hobby, so...

00:58:39.377 --> 00:58:42.617
To all the companies and management teams,

00:58:42.617 --> 00:58:45.137
I will absolutely make sure not to cause any trouble

00:58:45.137 --> 00:58:47.317
That's what I intend to do.

00:58:47.317 --> 00:58:48.897
I'm an independent, an independent VTuber.

00:58:48.897 --> 00:58:51.337
Everyone, I'm an independent VTuber.

00:58:53.097 --> 00:58:56.617
No, but I'm really happy you came.

00:58:56.617 --> 00:58:59.497
I feel so... empty.

00:58:59.497 --> 00:59:03.097
I'm so happy I've gone empty.

00:59:03.097 --> 00:59:05.637
Phew...

00:59:05.637 --> 00:59:07.097
No, really, even today,

00:59:07.097 --> 00:59:10.617
Thank you so much for taking the time out of your precious nap time

00:59:10.617 --> 00:59:13.137
Thank you so much.

00:59:13.137 --> 00:59:18.518
Has it been about an hour already?

00:59:18.518 --> 00:59:20.677
No, the beginning was a total mess,

00:59:20.677 --> 00:59:23.477
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:59:23.477 --> 00:59:24.518
Hehehe

00:59:24.518 --> 00:59:25.497
Oh, today I tried my best

00:59:25.497 --> 00:59:26.597
to hide my dialect while speaking...

00:59:26.597 --> 00:59:27.317
Am I doing it?

00:59:27.317 --> 00:59:29.157
Hehehehe

00:59:29.157 --> 00:59:31.577
I think I'll probably mess up later, but...

00:59:31.713 --> 00:59:35.614
From now on, as I said earlier, I think it'll be mostly drawing streams.

00:59:35.614 --> 00:59:40.433
I hope I can do a drawing stream sometime this week.

00:59:40.433 --> 00:59:43.293
It depends on my work progress, I guess.

00:59:43.293 --> 00:59:45.614
If I do, it'll probably be late at night.

00:59:45.614 --> 00:59:50.233
I'll let you know on Twitter or something.

00:59:50.233 --> 00:59:51.713
I'll secretly announce it, so...

00:59:51.713 --> 00:59:54.974
If you're free, please come hang out.

00:59:54.974 --> 00:59:59.453
Also, this information isn't out yet, so...

00:59:59.453 --> 01:00:06.034
I might be visiting someone somewhere next week.

01:00:06.034 --> 01:00:10.233
Once the channel owner announces it,

01:00:10.233 --> 01:00:14.453
I'll secretly piggyback and announce it with a 'Yay!'

01:00:14.453 --> 01:00:16.634
So please come hang out!

01:00:16.634 --> 01:00:18.054
Was I speaking in dialect? Really?

01:00:18.393 --> 01:00:19.273
No, you weren't.

01:00:19.273 --> 01:00:20.873
No, no, you weren't.

01:00:20.873 --> 01:00:23.574
You weren't.

01:00:23.574 --> 01:00:26.074
Let's keep it hidden.

01:00:26.074 --> 01:00:28.673
I'm a city girl, you know.

01:00:28.673 --> 01:00:29.233
Okay.

01:00:29.233 --> 01:00:29.333
Yes.

01:00:29.333 --> 01:00:29.353
Yes.

01:00:29.353 --> 01:00:29.373
Yes.

01:00:29.373 --> 01:00:29.393
Yes.

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:29.413
Yes.

01:00:29.413 --> 01:00:29.433
Yes.

01:00:29.433 --> 01:00:29.453
Yes.

01:00:29.453 --> 01:00:29.554
Yes.

01:00:29.554 --> 01:00:29.793
Yes.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:29.813
Yes.

01:00:29.813 --> 01:00:30.014
Yes.

01:00:30.014 --> 01:00:30.474
Yes.

01:00:30.474 --> 01:00:31.813
Yes.

01:00:31.813 --> 01:00:32.014
Yes.

01:00:32.014 --> 01:00:36.034
I wonder if the deliveries will be finished like this.

01:00:36.034 --> 01:00:37.933
Sorry if they're not.

01:00:37.933 --> 01:00:38.433
Sorry.

01:00:38.433 --> 01:00:38.733
Yes.

01:00:38.733 --> 01:00:38.793
Yes.

01:00:38.793 --> 01:00:38.882
Yes.

01:00:38.882 --> 01:00:39.014
Thank you so much for coming today!

01:00:39.014 --> 01:00:39.074
Yes

01:00:39.074 --> 01:00:39.134
Yes

01:00:39.134 --> 01:00:39.153
Yes

01:00:39.153 --> 01:00:39.173
Yes

01:00:39.193 --> 01:00:40.614
Yes

01:00:40.614 --> 01:00:41.514
Yes

01:00:41.514 --> 01:00:41.981
Yes

01:00:41.981 --> 01:00:43.081
I'm so happy.

01:00:43.081 --> 01:00:43.393
Thank you.

01:00:43.393 --> 01:00:45.702
Yes

01:00:45.702 --> 01:00:46.534
Well then, until we meet again!

01:00:46.534 --> 01:00:48.081
Matters

01:00:48.081 --> 01:00:49.933
Goodbye!

01:00:49.933 --> 01:00:50.001
여 Unterschied

01:00:50.001 --> 01:00:51.001
Bye-bye!

01:00:52.114 --> 01:00:52.994
Sweetness

01:00:52.994 --> 01:00:54.134
Is

Yes

01:00:54.953 --> 01:00:55.153
Yes

Yes

01:00:55.673 --> 01:00:55.953
Yes

Yes

Yeah

Yeah

01:00:58.173 --> 01:00:58.373
Yeah

01:00:58.373 --> 01:00:58.653
Yeah

01:00:58.653 --> 01:00:59.373
poner

01:00:59.373 --> 01:00:59.413
and we don't have anything to talk about
